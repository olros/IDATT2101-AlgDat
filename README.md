### Compile C with WSL
To compile and run C with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), run these commands in CMD:

```
wsl gcc -o <OutPutFileName> <FileName>.c -lm
wsl ./<OutPutFileName>
```

You must have downloaded `gcc` for this to work. You can check that you have installed `gcc` by typing: `wsl gcc --version`
